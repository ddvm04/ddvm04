<h3>Hello World</h3>
I’m @ddvm04, my name is Eduarda V. Martinelli, or Duda, if you like. I'm an English and Portuguese teacher and aspiring developer, all the way from kind of a small city in the South of Brazil. <br>
I studied English, Portuguese and its corresponding literatures in college. <br>
I also have a Masters degree in Literature - my thesis was about how booktubers can help acquire the habit of reading, changing the mechanisms of the editorial market and the way school develops the taste for books with children and teens. <br>
I think my knowledge about education and classroom practice can be useful when developing new tools for learning and teaching environments. <br>
I have always been very interested in techology and decided it was time to study on my own. <br>
I have this big big dream of becoming a game developer - I always dreamed about a job like this, but only figured out it is real and possible about a couple years ago. <br>
I’m currently learning Python. <br>
You can reach me on my ddvm04@gmail.com
